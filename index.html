        <section id="privacy-policy" class="hidden-section">
            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
            <p>PiTasker collects minimal information necessary for the operation of the App:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>**Task Activity Data:** Information about tasks you accept, submit, and complete (e.g., task ID, status, timestamps).</li>
                <li>**Device Information:** Basic device type and operating system (for compatibility and analytics).</li>
                <li>**No Personal Identifiable Information (PII):** PiTasker currently does not directly collect your name, email address, phone number, or other personal data that can identify you directly. Any connection to your Pi Network identity would be handled securely via the Pi SDK, not directly by this App.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
            <p>We use the collected information to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Enable task acceptance and tracking.</li>
                <li>Improve App functionality and user experience.</li>
                <li>Perform basic analytics on task engagement.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Data Storage</h3>
            <p>Task activity data is stored locally on your device using your browser's Local Storage. This data is not transmitted to any external server by this App.</p>

            <h3>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
            <p>PiTasker does not share or sell your data with third parties. As no PII is collected by the App directly, there is no personal data to share.</p>

            <h3>5. Third-Party Services</h3>
            <p>This App may link to or integrate with third-party services (e.g., Pi Network blockchain, Font Awesome for icons). Your use of those services is subject to their respective terms and privacy policies.</p>

            <h3>6. Your Choices</h3>
            <p>Since data is stored locally, you can clear this data by clearing your browser's or app's local storage/cache. This will reset your accepted tasks.</p>

            <h3>7. Security</h3>
            <p>We implement reasonable measures to protect the data stored locally on your device, but no local storage method is 100% secure against all threats.</p>

            <h3>8. Children's Privacy</h3>
            <p>PiTasker is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.</p>

            <h3>9. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

            <h3>10. Contact Us</h3>
            <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at [Your Contact Email Address, e.g., pitasker.support@example.com].</p>
